## About Me

I am a data scientist and research scientist with a background in hydrology and remote sensing.  
My M.Sc. work focuses on improving snow mapping techniques in complex terrain using optical satellite imagery.

I have worked with both spaceborne and airborne remote sensing products.  
I have experience with machine learning, physically-based models, and statistical/probabilistic modeling.

I will be completing my M.Sc. in Civil and Environmental Engineering in the [Mountain Hydrology Research Group](https://depts.washington.edu/mtnhydr/Pages/People%20Profiles/EmmaProfile.html) in August 2025.
